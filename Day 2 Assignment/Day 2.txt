1. Write a blog difference bteween window and document objects?

In the blog explores the document and window object, their various properties and methods, along with the difference between them.

Th Window Object: 
----------------
The window object represents the browser window or tab that a web pages is loaded into. It is the global object in a web browser,
meaning that all global javascript objects, functions and variable are members of the window object. It is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
It represents a browser window or frame that displays the content of the webpage. whenever a window appears on the screen to display 
the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

Syntax: window.property_name;
-------

Key Properties of the window object:
-----------------------------------

* 'window.innerWidth' and 'window.innerHeight': These properties return the interior width and height of the windows content area.

    console.log(window.innerWidth);
    console.log(window.innerHeight);

* 'window.history': These property provides access to the browsers session history (pages visited in the tab or frame).

    window.history.back();  // go back one page
    window.history.forward();  // go forward one page

Key Methods of the window object:
--------------------------------

* 'window.alert(message)': Displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

    window.alert("This ia an alert box!");

* 'window.open(url)': Open a new browser window or tab with the specified url.

    window.open("https://www.gubvi.com", "_blank");

Th Document Object: 
------------------
Th document object represents the HTML or XML document that is loaded into the window. It serves as an entry point to the content of the page,
allowing to access and manipulate the DOM(document object model). By accessing the document object, we can access the elements in the HTML page.
With the help of the document object, we can add dynamic content to our page. The document object can be accessed with 'window.document' or just 'document'.

Syntax: document.property_name;
------

Key Properties of the document object:
-------------------------------------

* 'document.title': Gets or sets the title of the document.

    console.log(document.title);
    document.title = "New title";   // set a new title

* 'document.body': Represents the '<body>' element of the document.

    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";   // change the background color of the body

 Key Methods of the document object:
-----------------------------------

* 'document.close': Used to close a document stream that was opened by the 'document.open()'.

    document.open();
    document.write("Hello, world!");
    document.close();

* 'document.write': Write HTML expressions or javascript code to the ducment.

    document.write("This is written by document.write()");

Key differences:
---------------

    1. Scope: 
            Window: Represents the entire browser window.
            Document: Represents the content loaded within the browser window which is one specific tab.

    2. Accessebility:
            Window: Accesses and manipulates the browser level data like tabs, history, screen size.
            Document: Manages and interacts specifically with the content of the webpage such as HTML, Style and DOM elemets. 

    3. Hierarchy:
            Window: The top level object in the hierarchy. There is a 'window.document' property which represents the document loaded in the window.
            Document: A property of the window object and cannot exist without it.
